Weather Forecast Homework

Using AJAX/APIS/CSS/HTML/JAVASCRIPT, I used to functions to:

Create a card for the user to enter a city
Create a section for a current day, and 5-day forecast
After submitting the city, presenting user with the current day's weather, and a 5-day forecast, utilizing the OpenWeather API
Providing fluctuating icons for each day depending on the weather
Saving recent searches in the local storage

WITH FUTURE TIME, I WOULD:
Put more creative thought in my weather icons
Make the page far better looking
Incorporate 'moment' so the day's time/date will automatically appear
